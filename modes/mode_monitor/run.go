// Package mode_monitor implements the "monitor" mode: it watches one or more registry subtrees
// on a refresh loop and reports the keys, values and security descriptors (ACLs) that change as
// they change, the way a live registry watcher does. The starting state is the baseline and
// is not printed; only subsequent changes are reported, each with a timestamp. Ctrl-C stops
// the loop cleanly.
//
// MS-RRP exposes no usable change-notification primitive here, so the mode polls: it walks
// the whole subtree each interval and diffs the new snapshot against the previous one. Unlike
// a signal-only notification, a diff can report exactly what changed, including the new value
// data and the new SDDL.
